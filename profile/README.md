# Embracing the Original Spirit of the Internet

At **Bitxenia**, we build alternative infrastructures for developing and deploying **community-based, distributed, and decentralized applications**.

Our goal is to **revive the original idea of the internet**: a collaborative, decentralized network where users share the responsibility of hosting, maintaining, and evolving their own applications.

By leveraging **peer-to-peer technologies**, we aim to provide the tools to build applications that are **resilient, open, and collectively owned**, empowering communities to create software that truly serves their members.

## Resources

### Documentation  
- [**Bitxenia Docs**](https://github.com/bitxenia/docs) — Technical documentation of the Bitxenia ecosystem, including architecture, infrastructure layers, and implementation details.

### Final Report  
- [*Ecosystem Analysis for Community-Oriented Platform-as-a-Service* (PDF)](https://github.com/bitxenia/informe-final/releases/download/1.0.2/informe-final.pdf) — Final report *(in Spanish)*: *“Análisis de ecosistemas para la implementación de plataformas como servicio para despliegue de aplicaciones comunitarias, distribuidas y descentralizadas.”*

## Ecosystem

Bitxenia is structured as a **modular ecosystem** built upon decentralized technologies such as **IPFS** and **Ethereum**, enabling communities to host, share, and govern their own applications.  
Each repository within the organization represents a component of this ecosystem — from distributed storage and communication layers to collaborative applications like **Astrawiki** and **Astrachat**.
